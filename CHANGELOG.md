# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **`without`**: the narrow-waist core. The `Stream` / `Processor` / `Context`
  contracts, the four builders (`from_map`, `from_scan`, `from_sink`,
  `from_fold`), the wiring connectors (`compose`, `sample`, `stream_from_iterable`,
  `stream_from_queue`, `collect`, `buffer`, `stack`), and the `with`-scoped task
  helpers (`background_task`, `limit_concurrency`, `sleep_forever`,
  `cancel_futures`, `as_async_iterator`).
- **`without-env`**: a static `Context` loaded once from environment variables
  with `pydantic-settings`.
- **`without-configmap`**: a behavior source backed by a Kubernetes ConfigMap
  mount, reloaded with `watchfiles` (watches the mount directory to catch the
  atomic `..data` symlink swap).
- **`without-asgi`**: adapters between an ASGI app's `receive`/`send` and typed
  event streams, complete in both the app and server directions, plus
  `make_asgi_app` and the unopinionated routing/middleware vocabulary.
- **`without-web`**: an opinionated HTTP/WebSocket router with trie matching,
  typed path parameters, converters, extractors, 405-vs-404, mounting, scoped
  middleware, exception handlers, and structure-recovered OpenAPI.
- **`without-http`**: an `asyncio` ASGI server and connection-pooling HTTP client
  built on the sans-IO `h11`/`h2`/`wsproto` state machines, serving HTTP/1.1,
  HTTP/2, and WebSockets (over the HTTP/1.1 upgrade), with TLS, keep-alive,
  streaming and buffered bodies, trailers, and client middleware.
- **`without-dag`**: bounded-concurrency execution of DAG-shaped async workflows,
  a typed `Graph` builder, and a single-input `CompiledGraph` that lifts straight
  into a `Processor` via `from_map`.
- Documentation site (mkdocs-material + mkdocstrings): narrative guides, an API
  reference recovered from the source docstrings, and a package dependency graph
  derived from the workspace `pyproject.toml` files.
