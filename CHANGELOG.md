# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **`without`**: the narrow-waist core. The `Stream` / `Processor` / `Context`
  contracts, the builders (`from_map`, `from_scan`, `from_sink`, `from_fold`, and
  the polarity-dual predicate filters `from_selector` / `from_filter`), the wiring
  connectors (`compose`, which also composes a processor onto a terminal `Sink`;
  `sample`, `stream_from_iterable`, `stream_from_queue`, `collect`, `buffer`,
  `stack`), and the `with`-scoped task helpers
  (`background_task`, `limit_concurrency`, `sleep_forever`, `cancel_futures`,
  `as_async_iterator`).
- **`without-env`**: a static `Context` loaded once from environment variables
  with `pydantic-settings`.
- **`without-configmap`**: a behavior source backed by a Kubernetes ConfigMap
  mount, reloaded with `watchfiles` (watches the mount directory to catch the
  atomic `..data` symlink swap).
- **`without-asgi`**: adapters between an ASGI app's `receive`/`send` and typed
  event streams, complete in both the app and server directions, plus
  `make_asgi_app` and the unopinionated routing/middleware vocabulary.
- **`without-web`**: an opinionated HTTP/WebSocket router with trie matching,
  typed path parameters, converters, extractors, 405-vs-404, mounting, scoped
  middleware, exception handlers, and structure-recovered OpenAPI.
- **`without-http`**: an `asyncio` ASGI server and connection-pooling HTTP client
  built on the sans-IO `h11`/`h2`/`wsproto` state machines, serving HTTP/1.1,
  HTTP/2, and WebSockets (over the HTTP/1.1 upgrade), with TLS, keep-alive,
  streaming and buffered bodies, trailers, and client middleware.
- **`without-dag`**: bounded-concurrency execution of DAG-shaped async workflows,
  a typed `Graph` builder, and a single-input `CompiledGraph` that lifts straight
  into a `Processor` via `from_map`.
- **`without-logging`**: a logging pipeline. Stdlib log records parsed into
  immutable `Record` values at a `capture` boundary (stdlib as a one-way source),
  filtered with the core `from_selector` (plus the `at_least` level predicate) and
  enriched with `add_fields`, drained to a sink the app owns. `offload` bridges a
  blocking worker onto a dedicated thread (delivering items in bursts, so the
  worker flushes when it catches up, no per-write thread hop) so file I/O stays off
  the event loop. Destination-shaped writers take strings (render a `Record` to text
  with a `from_map(Record -> str)` in front) and own the newline framing:
  `to_rotating_file` owns the byte count and clock, rotating on any combination of
  `max_bytes` (size), `max_age` (relative interval), and `schedule` (absolute
  wall-clock boundaries, built from times of day with `at_times`); `to_stream` writes
  to a caller-owned text stream (`sys.stderr`, a socket) without closing it.
- Documentation site (mkdocs-material + mkdocstrings): narrative guides, an API
  reference recovered from the source docstrings, and a package dependency graph
  derived from the workspace `pyproject.toml` files.
